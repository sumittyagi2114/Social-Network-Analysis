Network Representation:

The toolkit utilizes an adjacency matrix representation to capture the relationships and connections between individuals in the social network. It distinguishes between followers and followings, creating a directed graph that encapsulates the structure of the network. Temporal Analysis:

Time plays a crucial role in social networks, and the toolkit incorporates temporal data to measure the age of user accounts. This feature enables users to analyze the growth and evolution of the network over time. Communication Patterns:

The project includes a message matrix that reflects the communication patterns between individuals. Negative values signify the absence of messages, while positive values indicate the volume and direction of messages exchanged. Fake Account Detection:

A robust algorithm is implemented to identify potentially fake accounts within the social network. By considering factors such as depth, starting points, message content, and account age, the toolkit provides a list of suspicious accounts that may require further investigation. Influence and Popularity Analysis:

Users can explore the popularity and influence within the network using methods like mode calculation and relative scoring. The toolkit identifies the most popular individuals and evaluates their impact on the overall network. Friend Suggestions:

For users looking to expand their social circle, the toolkit offers a new friend suggestion feature. By considering factors like reliability scores and existing connections, the toolkit recommends potential new friends for each user.
